            <p>1. An automatic car is an automobile with an automatic transmission that doesn't require a driver to shift gears manually.</p>
            <p>2. Transmissions, also known as gearboxes, help to direct the rotational force and speed of a car.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore, automatic transmissions switch gear ratios as the vehicle moves.</p>
            <p>4. An automatic transmission uses sensors that allow it to shift gears at the appropriate time by using the internal oil pressure.</p>
            <p>5. Shifting gears happens when the transmission is disconnected from the engine temporarily, which is handled by the torque converter.</p>
